# Jira Connector

The Jira connector presents cards inviting the user to comment on an issue, watch an issue, or open an issue in a browser. It does this based on issue IDs passed as tokens in the card request.

Watching an issue and commenting on an issue are actions supported by this connector.

For generic details on how to build, install, and configure connectors, please see the [README](https://github.com/vmware/connectors-workspace-one/blob/master/README.md) at the root of this repository.
