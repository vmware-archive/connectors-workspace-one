# ServiceNow Connector

The ServiceNow connector presents cards inviting the user to approve or reject open requests. It does this based on request numbers passed as tokens in the card request.

Approving a request and rejecting a request are actions supported by this connector.

For generic details on how to build, install, and configure connectors, please see the [README](https://github.com/vmware/connectors-workspace-one/blob/master/README.md) at the root of this repository.
