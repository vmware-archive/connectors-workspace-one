# Socialcast Connector

The Socialcast connector does not presents cards. Instead it offers a single action, which posts an email thread to a new Socialcast group. It also invites recipients of the email to join Socialcast if they haven't already.

For generic details on how to build, install, and configure connectors, please see the [README](https://github.com/vmware/connectors-workspace-one/blob/master/README.md) at the root of this repository.
