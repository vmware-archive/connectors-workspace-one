# ServiceNow Connector for WS1 hub.

The ServiceNow connector presents cards inviting the user to approve or reject open requests. It does this based on the user's email address in the card request.

Approving a request and rejecting a request are actions supported by this connector.

For generic details on how to build, install, and configure connectors, please see the [README](https://github.com/vmware/connectors-workspace-one/blob/master/README.md) at the root of this repository.
