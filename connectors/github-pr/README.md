# GithubPr Connector

The GithubPr connector presents cards inviting the user to comment on, approve, reject, request changes, and merge Github pull requests. It does this based on the pull request URLs passed as tokens in the card request.

Approving, closing, commenting on, requesting changes on, and merging are actions supported by this connector.

For generic details on how to build, install, and configure connectors, please see the [README](https://github.com/vmware/connectors-workspace-one/blob/master/README.md) at the root of this repository.
