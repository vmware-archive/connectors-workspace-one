# AwsCert Connector

The AwsCert connector presents cards inviting the user to approve AWS certificate requests. It does this based on the URLs passed as tokens in the card request.

Approving a certificate request is the only action supported by this connector.

For generic details on how to build, install, and configure connectors, please see the [README](https://github.com/vmware/connectors-workspace-one/blob/master/README.md) at the root of this repository.
